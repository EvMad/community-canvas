# community-canvas

## Description

This application was built to create a space where art lovers/city dwellers can share street art found in their community and also view street art from communities all over the globe from user uploads. This application uses Cloudinary to store user uploads to a cloud folder and then uses Sequelize and MySQL to store the upload links along with user input. Bulma was used as the CSS framework and the app is run with an Express and Node server. Handlebars was implemented for the view routes and JavaScript for the logic.
